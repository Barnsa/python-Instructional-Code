# python-Instructional-Code
Code created as part of an instruction into python programming.

The code contained in some of these examples is incomplete as my students and I wrote the code sometimes together or i worte the base code we modified together. I'm very proud of the work that they managed to accomplish and you can judge much of my own style and coding ability based off of their code too.
