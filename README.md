# python-Instructional-Code
Code created as part of an instruction into python programming.

The code contained in most of these examples is incomplete as it was my students that wrote the code with my instruction. But I'm very proud of most of the work that they managed to accomplish and you can judge much of my own style and coding ability based off of their code.
